                <p>A little fed up with the hustle and bustle, want to be quiet want to carry a backpack, want to buy a ticket to the island. Like a sandwich, sandwiched in a crowded big city, I don't want to socialize or pretend to be okay. I don't want to work or be a hostage these days. I want to take out a time, can have no trouble to do a dream, carnival for me is not really useful. Back to the beach, the pool, the world I am not in a hurry, the white sand under my feet and the waves in the sea, give up all the travel I can still be ten days late.</p>

                <p>暇を見つけて、面倒なことなく夢を見たいのだが、お祭り騒ぎは僕にはあまり役に立たない。ビーチに戻って、プールサイド、私は、世界で最も急いでいない、足の裏の白い砂と海の波、すべての日程を改める私はまだ10日遅くすることができます。</p>

            <p>Behind the black is the dawn, think the coming days are long so don't wake up the dream, time to continue flying, the next station outside the airport, embrace your back. Behind the blue is pure, looking down at the missing eyes on the land, there are some things in life, never a reason to explain, a moment of silence.<br>If the clouds are a letter to the sky, can you listen again, listen to your voice. I don't blame you for exploring secrets and traveling with Peter Pan to uninhabited islands. The sky stretches as far as the eye can see, is the reflection of the ocean, blue stretches as far as the eye can see, where is my you. If lost must remember to miss into the bottle, remember to express to me don't let a person worry.</p>

            <p>I don't care what's out there hot style, who's yelling boring, I don't care who's pirated who, who's got a new springboard. I don't need anyone to come over with me, my actions are like alone, I don't care about their mouth said the river's lake, I only see a barren.<br>Those who can not give me happiness quickly get away, I do not need your existence, remove the dark clouds to find some sun, do not like you deliberately installed very high. I can get along with my loneliness in harmony, a person's queue is very enjoy, rare confused rare empty, tube you what lively do not want to gather together. I don't care about anything, I don't want to do anything, I don't want to do anything. So don't disturb. So don't disturb.</p>
